Founded on the idea that food            should be healthy, affordable, and good, &nbsp;How Do You Roll?            disrupted the sushi restaurant world. The restaurant chain started            with a "Chipotle of Sushi" idea of customizing sushi rolls but soon            expanded to incorporate other Asian dishes.</p>          <p class="columns"><em>Strategy: </em>Sushi inherently looks            beautiful and is easy to manipulate when it comes to photographing            it. HDYR? wanted to use this advantage to create a bigger foodie            following on all social media platforms.</p>          <p class="columns"><em>Creative Solution: </em>After photographing            new menu items for the the company's franchise brochure, I wanted to            showcase the sushi and the fresh ingredients HDYR? uses to engage            our followers and make them crave HDYR? around lunchtime. </p>          <h4>Franchise Brochure</h4>          <p>This brochure was the catalyst that gave me a new direction when it            came to showcasing HDYR?'s menu. The cover of the brochure is            playful and shows what happens after someone receives one of HDYR's            sushi rolls.</p>          <img src="images/backcover.png" alt="cover"> <img src="images/brochurespread.png"            alt="inside">          <h4>Never-Ending Content</h4>          <p>With social media, there is always new content to be posted. I            sought to make the finished menu product and the ingredients used to            make them works of art for our platforms. Best of all, I got to tell            people I played with my food for a living. </p>          <div class="wrap">            <div class="imgcolumn"> <img src="images/InstaGIF_hdyrfinal_bg.gif"                alt="Instagram"></div>            <div class="imgcolumn">              <div class="each third aa loadfade"> <img src="images/instahdyr_clip1.jpg"></div>              <div class="each third bb loadfade"> <img src="images/instahdyr_clip2.jpg"></div>              <div class="each third cc loadfade"> <img src="images/instahdyr_clip3.jpg"></div>            </div>            <div style="padding-top:15px;"></div>          </div>          <h4>International Sushi Day</h4>          <p>How Do You Roll? decided to go all out on International Sushi Day            by giving away a free California roll with any purchase. This was an            effort the whole marketing team knocked out of the park, but            prepping for it took months of planning. One part of that came in            the form of mapping out the social media strategy to get customers            through the door that day. Part I was about drumming up interest and            intrigue in the big day. Part II officially announced our give-away.            Part III counted down the days and made sure our customers had the            date stuck in their heads. Part IV showed our progress on our big            goal: giving away 1,000 free sushi rolls. </p>          <div class="slider"> <img src="images/sushidaycampaign.png" alt="Sushiday1"><img              src="images/eventannouncement.png"              alt="Sushiday2"><img              src="images/countdown.png"              alt="Sushiday3"><img              src="images/instacontest.png"              alt="Sushiday5"><img              src="images/sauceprogress.png"              alt="Sushiday6"><img              src="images/postsushiday.png"              alt="Sushiday7"></div>          <div class="wrap">            <div class="imgcolumn"> <img src="images/InstaGIF_sushidayfinal_bg.gif"                alt="Instagram"></div>            <div class="imgcolumn">              <div class="each third aa loadfade"> <img src="images/sushiday_clip1.jpg"></div>              <div class="each third bb loadfade"> <img src="images/sushiday_clip2.jpg"></div>              <div class="each third cc loadfade"> <img src="images/sushiday_clip3.jpg"></div>            </div>          </div>          <h4>Longform Content</h4>          <p>Working from some of the ways I showcased sushi and its            ingredients, I was lucky enough to design some long-form content for            HDYR? through our blog. We used this as a way to introduce seasonal            menu items as well as give our visitors some insight into the            history of the food. </p>          <div class="slider" style="width:80%;"> <img src="images/ipad_blog1_bg.png"              alt="Apple1"><img              src="images/ipad_blog2_bg.png"              alt="Apple2"><img              src="images/ipad_caliroll_bg.png"              alt="CaliRollHistory"></div>          <h4>Re-Designing the Line</h4>          <p>There are two ways the line has been used in How Do You Roll?'s            flagship location. Line A represents HDYR? at a time when the focus            was on customizing your own roll and customers needed to pass by the            ingredients. Line B is the latest version with the register moved            further towards the door. Customers will not have to wander to the            back of the restaurant, but they also can become lined up out the            door.</p>          <div class="wrap">            <div class="imgcolumn"> <img src="images/hdyrline1.png" alt="HDYRLINE1"></div>            <div class="imgcolumn"> <img src="images/hdyrline2.png" alt="HDYRLINE2"></div>          </div>          <p> The serpentine line (one longer line with multiple service points)            has been regarded as the most efficient way of queueing.</p>          <img src="images/hdyrline3_serpentine.png" alt="Serpentine">          <p> What if you had a virtual serpentine? By having customers order            from a tablet, it allows their digital order to take their place in            line and for them to find a spot to sit right away. It also frees up            the cashier to bus tables or to have more face-to-face contact with            customers who have questions. It allows the restaurant to be run by            3-4 workers very efficiently without one person getting caught            behind the register.</p>          <img src="images/hdyrline4_solution.png" alt="Solution"></div>        <p class="columns">A digital menu allows customers to peruse the menu at          their leisure (just like at a traditional restaurant) without having          the pressure of holding up a line. An "Ask the Server" button is under          the "Order" button so customers can clear up any lingering questions          they might have. With a digital line, customers can have relaxed          restaurant experience with fast-casual restaurant prices. Workers are          free from being stuck behind a cash register and can help make each          customer's visit a memorable one.</p>        <img style="width: 40%;" src="images/MENU.gif" alt="Menu">        <div class="nextproject"><br>          <br>          <a class="noweb" href="getaround.html">            <p><em>Next</em></p>          </a> </div>      </div>    </div>    <div style="display: none;">      <div class="niice-bar" id="niice-bar">        <div class="boards"> </div>        <div class="loading-spinner">Loading…</div>        <div class="error-text"> <span class="msg"></span> <span class="close-cross">×</span>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <div id="extension-is-installed"></div>  </body></html>
